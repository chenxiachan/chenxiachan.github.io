I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Munich Data Science Institute](https://www.mdsi.tum.de/mdsi/startseite/), [Georg Nemetschek Institute (GNI)](https://www.mdsi.tum.de/gni/startseite/), Technical University of Munich, selected by the TUM GNI Postdoc Program. My research seeks *augmented intelligence*: computational systems that dynamically adapt while protecting human autonomy.

My current focus is on investigating how temporal encoding and dynamical regimes shape computation, generalization, and learning efficiency. This work integrates dynamical systems, neuromorphic intelligence, causal modeling, and human-AI co-adaptation, toward a unified framework for scientific machine assistance.

Previously, I earned my Ph.D. with *summa cum laude* distinction at Leibniz University Hannover and Technical University Berlin, supervised by [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Philipp Geyer (Heisenbergprofessor)](https://www.iek.uni-hannover.de/de/ngs/team/prof-dr-philipp-geyer) and [Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Marius Lindauer](https://www.ai.uni-hannover.de/de/lindauer). My dissertation, "*<span style="border-bottom:2px dashed yellow;">Beyond Predictions: Alignment between Prior Knowledge and Machine Learning for Human-centered Augmented Intelligence</span>*" lays the foundation for my research into adaptive intelligence systems that respect and extend human autonomy. It is structured around three pillars:
- *Decision-Making Process Alignment*
- *Methodological Paradigm Alignment*
- *Interaction Pattern Alignment*

In early 2024, I was a Visiting Scholar at the  [Center for the Built Environment (CBE)](https://cbe.berkeley.edu/), UC Berkeley, where I explored how causal inference and AI can enhance decision-making in energy-efficient design. This work bridges to my present interest in AI systems that enhance, rather than replace, scientific and engineering reasoning.
