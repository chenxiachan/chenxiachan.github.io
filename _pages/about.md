I am a Ph.D. candidate at Leibniz University Hannover/Technical University Berlin in Germany (2020-2024 expected), research affiliate, and lecturer at the [Institute of Sustainable Building Systems](https://www.iek.uni-hannover.de/de/gebauedetechnik/), under the supervision of Heisenbergprofessor, [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Philipp Geyer](https://www.iek.uni-hannover.de/de/ngs/team/prof-dr-philipp-geyer).

Starting in January 2024, I'll be a Visiting Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, undertaking research in the [Center for the Built Environment (CBE)](https://cbe.berkeley.edu/), investigating how AI embedded with causal inference benefits the engineering domain.

As a posthumanist, my research goal is to make efforts toward achieving general [augmented intelligence](https://digitalreality.ieee.org/publications/what-is-augmented-intelligence#:~:text=Augmented%20intelligence%20is%20a%20subsection,in%20response%20to%20improved%20decisions.), which involves integrating prior knowledge (first-principles methods) into data-driven approaches, causal inference analysis, and exploring new patterns for human-computer interaction. Most of my works are adapted to engineering/design process support scenarios.

My dissertation, "*<span style="border-bottom:2px dashed yellow;">Beyond Predictions: Alignment between Prior Knowledge and Machine Learning for Human-centered Augmented Intelligence</span>*", encompasses my research during my Ph.D. and emphasizes the vital need for alignment between human intelligence and machine capacities to enhance, rather than undermine, human capabilities and autonomy. The core content is organized into three essential objectives: *Decision-Making Processes Alignment*, *Methodological Paradigms Alignment*, and *Interaction Pattern Alignment*. The online version will be released soon.

Invited Talks and Interviews:
