I am a Ph.D. researcher at Leibniz University Hannover/Technical University Berlin, where I have received *summa cum laude* distinction for my dissertation, "*<span style="border-bottom:2px dashed yellow;">Beyond Predictions: Alignment between Prior Knowledge and Machine Learning for Human-centered Augmented Intelligence</span>*", under the supervision of [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Philipp Geyer (Heisenbergprofessor)](https://www.iek.uni-hannover.de/de/ngs/team/prof-dr-philipp-geyer) and [Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Marius Lindauer](https://www.ai.uni-hannover.de/de/lindauer). My research highlights the vital need for alignment between human intelligence and machine learning to enhance, rather than undermine, human capabilities and autonomy.

My dissertation is organized around three key objectives: *Decision-Making Processes Alignment*, *Methodological Paradigms Alignment*, and *Interaction Pattern Alignment*, and it serves as the foundation for my work in augmenting human capabilities with AI.

From January to June 2024, I was a Visiting Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, conducting research at the [Center for the Built Environment (CBE)](https://cbe.berkeley.edu/). My work there focuses on how AI embedded with causal inference can support decision-making processes in the engineering domain.

As a posthumanist, I am passionate about achieving general [augmented intelligence](https://digitalreality.ieee.org/publications/what-is-augmented-intelligence#:~:text=Augmented%20intelligence%20is%20a%20subsection,in%20response%20to%20improved%20decisions), integrating prior knowledge (first-principles methods) into data-driven approaches, causal inference analysis, and exploring new human-computer interaction paradigms. My research has significant applications in engineering and design processes, supporting decision-making and enhancing system performance.
