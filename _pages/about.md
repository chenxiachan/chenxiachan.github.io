I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Munich Data Science Institute](https://www.mdsi.tum.de/mdsi/startseite/), [Georg Nemetschek Institute (GNI)](https://www.mdsi.tum.de/gni/startseite/), Technical University of Munich, selected by the TUM GNI Postdoc Program. 

My research aims to advance *Augmented Intelligence*: adaptive systems that align machine dynamics with human reasoning and autonomy. I approach this through the lens of dynamical systems theory, neuromorphic computation, and knowledge-integrated machine learning, seeking a unified framework for adaptive, interpretable, and human-aligned AI.

Previously, I earned my Ph.D. with *summa cum laude* distinction at Technical University Berlin and Leibniz University Hannover, supervised by [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Philipp Geyer (Heisenbergprofessor)](https://www.iek.uni-hannover.de/de/ngs/team/prof-dr-philipp-geyer) and [Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Marius Lindauer](https://www.ai.uni-hannover.de/de/lindauer). My dissertation, "*<span style="border-bottom:2px dashed yellow;">Beyond Predictions: Alignment between Prior Knowledge and Machine Learning for Human-centered Augmented Intelligence</span>*" established foundational building blocks for aligning data-driven systems with domain knowledge and human-in-the-loop processes. It is structured around three dimensions:
- *Decision-Making Process Alignment*
- *Methodological Paradigm Alignment*
- *Interaction Pattern Alignment*

In early 2024, I was a Visiting Scholar at the  [Center for the Built Environment (CBE)](https://cbe.berkeley.edu/), UC Berkeley, where I explored how causal inference and AI ethics can enhance decision-making in engineering reasoning. This work is an applied step toward scientific machine assistance.
