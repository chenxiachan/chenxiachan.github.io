**Abstract**: <br>
Nowadays, sustainability objective has risen to the most attention in building engineering scenarios. Multi-objective optimization techniques can act as assistance in supporting decision-making in a trade-off of various considerations in an interdisciplinary manner. In this study, we propose a recommendation system to alleviate the difficulty of informed decision-making regarding the rapid potential design space exploration, optimal design solution analysis, and dynamic interaction aligned with ongoing processes. To illustrate how the recommendation system is organized to help designers or engineers approach the general sustainability objective, an early design phase case study based on a real-world, massive energy performance certification dataset is conducted. The generated results conform to interpretations based on domain knowledge, which validate the effectiveness of the system assistance.<br>
